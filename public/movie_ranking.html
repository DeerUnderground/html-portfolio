<h1>My favorite movies (according to me)</h1>
<h2>My top 5 (totally unbiased)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Etienne's mother</h3>
<p>
The visuals were almost as breathtaking as the experience itself.
</p>
<h3>2. Joe's Pizza</h3>
<p>
I cried during this movie.
</p>
<h3>3. Oppenheimer</h3>
<p> 
    A visual masterpiece by Christopher Nolan with brilliant performances from Emily Blunt and Cillian Murphy.
</p>
<h3>4. Barbie</h3>
<p>
    Can't not have this parody of a movie on the list.
</p>
<h3>5. Inception</h3>
<p>
    Can't believe Leo DiCaprio <br /> attended the premiere<br /> and by the time the movie was done,<br /> his date was too old for him!
